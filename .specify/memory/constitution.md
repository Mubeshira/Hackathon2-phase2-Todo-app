# Project Constitution

## Core Rules

1. **No Manual Code**: Do not write any implementation code until the specification and plan are approved.
2. **Hierarchy of Truth**: Constitution > Specify > Plan > Tasks > Implement.
3. **History Tracking**: Maintain a `/specs/history` folder. Before updating any spec file, move the old version there with a timestamp.
4. **Tech Stack**: Next.js 16+, FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon DB, and Better Auth (JWT).

## Branding Guidelines

- **Background**: Pure White (#FFFFFF)
- **Primary Buttons**: Purple (#800080)
- **Detailing/Accents**: Pink (#FF69B4)

## Development Principles

- Follow Spec-Driven Development (SDD) methodology
- Maintain clear separation between specification, planning, and implementation phases
- Ensure all changes are tracked and versioned appropriately
- Prioritize security and data integrity in all implementations
- Maintain clean, readable, and maintainable code
